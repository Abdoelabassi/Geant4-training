Primary generation: Hands-on
============================

We will keep using the source code in exDay2/ in these exercises.
A class to generate the primary particles of an event is mandatory.
The goal is to exercise the different functionality for the generator class.

Exercise 1.
-----------
Run the application in interactive mode.
- a. using built-in /gun/ UI commands change primary particle type
     from e- to e+, proton, mu-, gamma 
- b. change energy of the primary
- c. run in verbose mode

Exercise 2.
-----------
Change primary particle parameters in YourPrimaryGenerator class
- a. define primary e+
- b. define energy 10 MeV
- c. define position at the border of the world volume
- d. define position in the middle of the target 

Exercise 3
----------
Change primary particle parameters in YourPrimaryGenerator class
- a. define primary e+
- b. define position on the surface of the target
- c. define random position on the surface for each new primary
