Lecture topics
==============
- What is Geant4 ?  
  - What is the difference between a tool and a toolkit / library?
- First steps: describing your detector geometry
  - Key geometry concepts

Note: We assume familiary with basics of C++ , but try to point out some aspects as we use them.   We target this intermediate level of expected C++ knowledge, expecting it will be neither too low nor too high for participants.

Hands-on
========
- [A0](./Task-A0.md) Exploring the Geant4 Virtual Machine 
- [A1](./Task-A1.md) What is a Geant4 application and how to use it ?
       - Goals: familiarise with program main, contents of directories,
       compiling and running an executable
- [A2](./Task-A2.md) Writing our own application.
       - Main program + Adding a volume to the world
- [A3](./Task-A3.md) Quick tour of key resources for Geant4 -
       documentation, doxygen, examples

Homework 
========
- [AX](./Task-AX.md) Add a tube to the setup from [A2](./Task-A2.md)
